# Twitter Sentiment Classification using LSTM
### Overview
This project aims to classify the sentiment of tweets using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. Twitter, being a massive source of user-generated content, provides a rich dataset for sentiment analysis.

### Requirements
-Python (>=3.6)
-TensorFlow (>=2.0)
-NumPy
-Pandas
-NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
-Matplotlib
-scikit-learn
-Installation

###Clone the repository:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/gladyswambura/Twitter-Sentiment-classification--LSTM.git

```
### Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Model Architecture
The LSTM neural network architecture used in this project consists of an embedding layer, LSTM layers, and a dense layer for classification. LSTM networks are well-suited for sequential data like text due to their ability to retain information over long sequences.
